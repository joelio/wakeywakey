- Fine-grained control over what to prevent:
  - Display sleep
  - Disk sleep
  - System sleep
- Launch at startup option
- Clean, native macOS menu bar interface
- Minimal resource usage

## Installation

### Option 1: Direct Download

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/joelio/wakeywakey/releases) page
2. Open the DMG file and drag Wakey Wakey to your Applications folder
3. Launch Wakey Wakey from your Applications folder

### Option 2: Homebrew

```bash
brew install yourusername/wakeywakey/wakeywakey
```

## Usage

1. Click the menu bar icon (moon icon when inactive, sun icon when active)

## Building from Source

### Requirements

- macOS 11.0+
- Xcode 13.0+
- Swift 5.5+

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joelio/wakeywakey.git
   cd wakeywakey
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open WakeyWakey.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Build and run the app (âŒ˜+R)

## How It Works

Wakey Wakey uses macOS's native `caffeinate` command-line utility to prevent sleep. This is the same utility that the built-in "caffeinate" command uses, but with a friendly GUI and additional features.
